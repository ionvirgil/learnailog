## Main log

Today I watched the Lecture 1 - What is computation from the MIT course on OCW - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python. The lecture was introductive, I managed to get some notes. I need to review the notes and the slides to do the problem sets. Also, I have to get into the Readings based on the book Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python with Applications to Understanding Data by John V. Guttag.

Note 1 - Programming resolves around problem solving, knowledge of conceps and programming skill.

Note 2 - Course topics 

1. Represent knowledge with data structures  - ***I HAVE TO GET MORE INTO THIS***
2. Iteration and recursion as computational metaphors.
3. Abstraction of procedures and data types
4. Organize and modularize systems using object classes and methods - This is to get better code organisation, and for others to understand what you did, easily.
5. Different classes of algorithms, searching and sorting
6. Complexity of algorithms

## What does a computer do?

It performs calculations and remembers results. 

There are built in calculations, and those that you define as the programmer.

COMPUTERS ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU TELL THEM - REMEMBER THIS!
