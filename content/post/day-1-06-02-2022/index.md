## Controlled experiments

Controlled experiments have been around for a long period of time. They have been used by statisticians, government officials and experts in private companies.

Controlled experiments are used to better understand how a specific group reacts to an experiment. 

By experiments we mean actions, treatments, measures and processes that alter the group in a specific way.

In a vaccine experiment, there are 4 parts to a controlled experiment that we need to remember:

1. The experiment group = the group that recieves a treatment.
2. The control group = this is the group that doesn't recieve a treatment, for example, but you use it to see the differences between the experiment group and the control group. You use it to see if people who were not vaccinated respond the same to the disease as those who were vaccinated. 
3. The random selection process = This is very important to the expriment because it allows for both groups to be randomlly built. Using for example a coin, it gives you a 50-50 percent chance to distribute a group into two groups, the experiment group (people that got a vaccine) and the control group (people that did not get the vaccine).
4. The double blind process = This means that neither the people who make the experiment, nor the people who support the expriment know in which group everybody is. This lets the experiment go as natural as possible.
